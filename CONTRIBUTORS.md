The materials in this python-humanities-lesson repository were initially developed
and adapted and continue to be revised by many contributors. Some of the lessons
were adapted from Software Carpentry materials.

The first Python Data Carpentry workshop was run at University of Miami on March
30 2015 John Gosset and Francois Michonneau. During this time materials were
refined and they presented again at the UCAR Software Engineering Assembly (SEA)
conference in Boulder, Colorado by Leah Wasser (NEON,Inc) and Mariela Perignon.
