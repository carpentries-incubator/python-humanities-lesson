# Data workflows and automation

So far, we've used Python and the pandas library to explore and manipulate
individual datasets by hand, much like we would do in a spreadsheet. The beauty
of using a programming language like Python, though, comes from the ability to
automate data processing through the use of loops and functions.

#Learning Objectives

* Learn the basics of a python for loop
* Learn how to create a function
* Learn how to loop through a directory of files, to automate processing
* Understand the basics of conditional (if, then, else) statements
* 

##For loops

Loops allow us to repeat a workflow (or series of actions) a given number of
times or while some condition is true. We would use a loop to automatically
process data that's stored in multiple files (daily values with one file per
year, for example). Loops lighten our work load by performing repeated tasks
without our direct involvement and make it less likely that we'll introduce
errors by making mistakes while processing each file by hand.

Let's write a simple for loop that simulates what a kid would say during a
spelling bee:

```python
    word = 'species'
    
    print word
    
    for letter in word:
        print letter
        
    print word

    species
    s
    p
    e
    c
    i
    e
    s
    species
```

The line defining the loop must start with `for` and end with a colon, and the
body of the loop must be indented.

In this example, `letter` is the loop variable that takes the value of the next
entry in `word` every time the loop goes around. We can call the loop variable
anything we like. After the loop finishes, the loop variable will still exist
and will have the value of the last entry in the collection:

```python
    word = 'species'
    
    for letter in word:
        pass
    
    print 'The loop variable is now: ' + letter

    The loop variable is now: s
```

We are not asking the loop to print the value of the loop variable anymore, but
the for loop is still repeating and the value of `letter` is changing every
time. The statement `pass` in the body of the loop just means "do nothing".

###Challenge:

1. What happens if we don't include the `pass` statement?

2. Rewrite the loop so that the letters are separated by dashes, not returns
(Hint: You can concatenate strings using a plus sign. For example,  `print
string1 + string2` outputs 'string1string2')

## Automating data processing using For Loops

The file we've been using so far, surveys.csv, contains 25 years of data and is
very large. We would like to separate the data for each year into a separate
file.

Let's start by making a new directory inside the folder `data` to store all of
these files using the module `os`:

```python
    import os
    
    os.mkdir('data/yearly_files')
```


The command `os.mkdir` is equivalent to `mkdir` in the shell. Just so we are
sure, we can check that the new directory was created within the folder `data`:

```python
    os.listdir('data')
```

```
    ['plots.csv',
     'portal_mammals.sqlite',
     'species.csv',
     'survey2001.csv',
     'survey2002.csv',
     'surveys.csv',
     'surveys2002_temp.csv',
     'yearly_files']
```


The command `os.listdir` is equivalent to `ls` in the shell.

In previous lessons, we saw how to use the library pandas to load the species
data into memory as a DataFrame, how to select a subset of the data using some
criteria, and how to write the DataFrame into a csv file. Let's write a script
that performs those three steps in sequence for the year 2002:

```python
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Load the data into a DataFrame
    surveys_df = pd.read_csv('data/surveys.csv')
    
    # Select only data for 2002
    surveys2002 = surveys_df[surveys_df.year == 2002]
    
    # Write the new DataFrame to a csv file
    surveys2002.to_csv('data/yearly_files/surveys2002.csv')
```

To create yearly data files, we could repeat the last two commands over and
over, once for each year of data. Repeating code is neither elegant nor
practical, and is very likely to introduce errors into your code. We want to
turn what we've just written into a loop that repeats the last two commands for
every year in the dataset.

Let's start by writing a loop that simply prints the names of the files we want
to create - the dataset we are using covers 1977 through 2002, and we'll create
a separate file for each of those years. Listing the filenames is a good way to
confirm that the loop is behaving as we expect.

We are using a function called `range` that creates a list of integers using the
syntax `range(start,end,step)`. The values of `start`,`end` and `step` must all
be integers. If this function only receives two numbers, it assumes that the
step length is 1. If it only receives one number, it assumes that the sequence
of numbers starts at zero.

```python
    for year in range(1977,2002):
        filename = 'data/yearly_files/surveys' + str(year) + '.csv'
        print filename
```

```
    data/yearly_files/surveys1977.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1978.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1979.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1980.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1981.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1982.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1983.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1984.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1985.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1986.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1987.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1988.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1989.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1990.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1991.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1992.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1993.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1994.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1995.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1996.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1997.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1998.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1999.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys2000.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys2001.csv
```

Our list of filenames is incomplete! It correctly started with 1977 and stepped
forward by 1 year, but it stopped with 2001. The function `range` continues to
add integers to the sequence as long as they are less than the stop value. This
is easier to see if we create a sequence of numbers that stops part-way through
a step:

```python
    print 'This one stops at half a step:', range(0,5,2)
```
```
    This one stops at half a step: [0, 2, 4]
```

Notice, that the output is the same if your range ends at 6.

```python
    print 'This one stops at half a step, too:', range(0,6,2)
```
```
    This one stops at half a step, too: [0, 2, 4]
```

To write a loop that includes the year 2002, we must make the stop value for
`range` an integer greater than that value but not so large that the sequence
goes too far:

```python
    for year in range(1977,2003):
        filename = 'data/yearly_files/surveys' + str(year) + '.csv'
        print filename
```
```
    data/yearly_files/surveys1977.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1978.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1979.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1980.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1981.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1982.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1983.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1984.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1985.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1986.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1987.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1988.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1989.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1990.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1991.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1992.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1993.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1994.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1995.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1996.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1997.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1998.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys1999.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys2000.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys2001.csv
    data/yearly_files/surveys2002.csv
```

We can now add the rest of the steps we need to create separate text files:

```python
    # Load the data into a DataFrame
    surveys_df = pd.read_csv('data/surveys.csv')
    
    for year in range(1977,2003):
    
        # Select data for the year
        surveys_year = surveys_df[surveys_df.year == year]
        
        # Write the new DataFrame to a csv file
        filename = 'data/yearly_files/surveys' + str(year) + '.csv'
        surveys_year.to_csv(filename)
```

Look inside the `yearly_files` directory and check a couple of the files you
just created to confirm that everything worked as expected.

## Writing Unique FileNames
Notice that the code above created a unique filename for each year. 

	filename = 'data/yearly_files/surveys' + str(year) + '.csv'

Let's break down the parts of this name:

*  The first part is simply some text that specifies the directory to store our data file in (data/yearly_files/) and the first part of the file name (surveys): `'data/yearly_files/surveys'`
*  We can concatenate this with a variable, in this case the year by using the plus `+` sign and the variable we want to add to the file name: `+ str(year)`
*  Then we add the file extension as another text string: `+ '.csv'`

Notice that we use single quotes to add text strings. The variable is not surrounded by quotes. This code produces the string `data/yearly_files/surveys2002.csv` which contains the path to the new filename AND the file name itself.

###Challenge:

1. Some of the surveys you saved are missing data (they have null values that
show up as NaN - Not A Number - in the DataFrames and do not show up in the text
files). Modify the for loop so that the entries with null values are not
included in the yearly files.

2. What happens if there is no data for a year in the sequence (for example,
imagine we had used 1976 as the start year in `range`)?

## Building reusable and modular code with functions

Suppose that separating large data files into individual yearly files is a task
that we frequently have to perform. We could write a For Loop like the one above
every time we needed to do it but that would be time consuming and error prone.
A more elegant solution would be to create a reusable tool that performs this
task with minimum input from the user. To do this, we are going to turn the code
we've already written into a function.

Functions are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that are called with a
single command. They can be designed to accept arguments as input and return
values, but they don't need to do either. Variables declared inside functions
only exist while the function is running and if a variable within the function
(a local variable) has the same name as a variable somewhere else in the code,
the local variable hides but doesn't overwrite the other.

Every method used in Python (for example, `print`) is a function, and the
libraries we import (say, `pandas`) are a collection of functions. We will only
use functions that are housed within the same code that uses them, but it's also
easy to write functions that can be used by different programs.


Functions are declared following this general structure:

```python
    def this_is_the_function_name(input_argument1, input_argument2):
        
        # The body of the function is indented
        # This function prints the two arguments to screen
        print 'The function arguments are:', input_argument1, input_argument2, '(this is done inside the function!)'
        
        # And returns their product
        return input_argument1*input_argument2
```

The function declaration starts with the word `def`, followed by the function
name and any arguments in parenthesis, and ends in a colon. The body of the
function is indented just like loops are. If the function returns something when
it is called, it includes a return statement at the end.

This is how we call the function:

```python
    product_of_inputs = this_is_the_function_name(2,5)
    
    print 'Their product is:', product_of_inputs, '(this is done outside the function!)'
```
```
    The function arguments are: 2 5 (this is done inside the function!)
    Their product is: 10 (this is done outside the function!)
```

### Challenge:

1. Change the values of the arguments in the function and check its output
2. Try calling the function by giving it the wrong number of arguments (not 2)
or not assigning the function call to a variable (no `product_of_inputs =`)
3. Declare a variable inside the function and test to see where it exists (Hint:
can you print it from outside the function?)
4. Explore what happens when a variable both inside and outside the function
have the same name. What happens to the global variable when you change the
value of the local variable?

We can now turn our code for saving yearly data files into a function. There are
many different "chunks" of this code that we can turn into functions, and we can
even create functions that call other functions inside them. Let's first write a
function that separates data for just one year and saves that data to a file:

```python
    def one_year_csv_writer(this_year, all_data):
        """
        Writes a csv file for data from a given year.
    
        this_year --- year for which data is extracted
        all_data --- DataFrame with multi-year data
        """
        
        # Select data for the year
        surveys_year = all_data[all_data.year == this_year]
        
        # Write the new DataFrame to a csv file
        filename = 'data/yearly_files/function_surveys' + str(this_year) + '.csv'
        surveys_year.to_csv(filename)
```

The text between the two sets of triple double quotes is called a docstring and
contains the documentation for the function. It does nothing when the funciton
is running and is therefore not necessary, but it is good practice to include
docstrings as a reminder of what the code does. Docstrings in functions also
become part of their 'official' documentation:

```python
    one_year_csv_writer?
```

This function performs the task of selecting data and writing a csv file for
just one year. Nothing happens if you run the function by itself, though - a
function needs to be called in order to do something. Let's call this function
to write the file for the year 2002:

```python
    one_year_csv_writer(2002,surveys_df)
```

We changed the root of the name of the csv file so we can distinguish it from
the one we wrote before. Check the yearly_files directory for the file. Did it
do what you expect?

What we really want to do, though, is create files for multiple years without
having to request them one by one. Let's write another function that replaces
the entire For Loop by simply looping through a sequence of years and repeatedly
call the function we just wrote, `one_year_csv_writer`:


```python
    def yearly_data_csv_writer(start_year, end_year, all_data):
        """
        Writes separate csv files for each year of data.
    
        start_year --- the first year of data we want
        end_year --- the last year of data we want
        all_data --- DataFrame with multi-year data
        """
        
        # "end_year" is the last year of data we want to pull, so we loop to end_year+1
        for year in range(start_year, end_year+1):
    
            one_year_csv_writer(year, all_data)
```

Because people will naturally say that the end year for the files is the last
year with data, the for loop inside the function ends at `end_year + 1`. By
writing the entire loop into a function, we've made a reusable tool for whenever
we need to break a large data file into yearly files. Because we can specify the
first and last year for which we want files, we can even use this function to
create files for a subset of the years available. This is how we call this
function:

```python
    # Load the data into a DataFrame
    surveys_df = pd.read_csv('data/surveys.csv')
    
    # Create csv files
    yearly_data_csv_writer(1977,2002,surveys_df)
```

BEWARE! If you are using iPython notebooks and you modify a function, you MUST
re-run that cell in order for the changed function to be available to the rest
of the code. Nothing will visibly happen when you do this, though, because
running a function by itself, without a call to the function, doesn't produce an
output. Any cells that use the now-changed functions will also have to be re-run
for their output to change.

### Challenge:

1. Add two arguments to the functions we wrote that take the path of the
directory where the files will be written and the root of the file name. Create
a new set of files with a different name in a different directory.

2. How could you use the function `yearly_data_csv_writer` to create a csv file
for only one year? (Hint: think about the syntax for `range`)

3. Make the functions return a list of the files they have written. There are
many ways you can do this (and you should try them all!): either of the
functions can print to screen, either can use a return statement to give back
numbers or strings to their function call, or you can use some combination of
the two. You could also try using the `os` library to list the contents of
directories.

4. Explore what happens when variables are declared inside each of the functions
or in the main code. What is the scope of the variables (where are they
visible)? What happens when they have the same name but are given different
values?

The functions we wrote demand that we give them a value for every argument.
Ideally, we would like these functions to be as flexible and independent as
possible. Let's modify the function `yearly_data_csv_writer` so that the
`start_year` and `end_year` default to the full range of the data if they are
not supplied by the user. Arguments can be given default values with an equal
sign in the function declaration. Any arguments in the function without default
values (here, `all_data`) is a required argument and MUST come before the
argument with default values (which are optional in the function call).

```python
    def yearly_data_arg_test(all_data, start_year = 1977, end_year = 2002):
        """
        Modified from yearly_data_csv_writer to test default argument values!
    
        start_year --- the first year of data we want --- default: 1977
        end_year --- the last year of data we want --- default: 2002
        all_data --- DataFrame with multi-year data
        """
        
        return start_year, end_year
            
        
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df, 1988, 1993)
    print 'Both optional arguments:\t', start, end
    
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df)
    print 'Default values:\t\t\t', start, end
```

```
    Both optional arguments:	1988 1993
    Default values:			1977 2002
```

The "\t" in the `print` statements are tabs, used to make the text align and be
easier to read.

But what if our dataset doesn't start in 1977 and end in 2002? We can modify the
function so that it looks for the start and end years in the dataset if those
dates are not provided:

```python
    def yearly_data_arg_test(all_data, start_year = None, end_year = None):
        """
        Modified from yearly_data_csv_writer to test default argument values!
    
        start_year --- the first year of data we want --- default: None - check all_data
        end_year --- the last year of data we want --- default: None - check all_data
        all_data --- DataFrame with multi-year data
        """
        
        if not start_year:
            start_year = min(all_data.year)
        if not end_year:
            end_year = max(all_data.year)
        
        return start_year, end_year
            
        
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df, 1988, 1993)
    print 'Both optional arguments:\t', start, end
    
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df)
    print 'Default values:\t\t\t', start, end
```
```
    Both optional arguments:	1988 1993
    Default values:			1977 2002
```

The default values of the `start_year` and `end_year` arguments in the function
`yearly_data_arg_test` are now `None`. This is a build-it constant in Python
that indicates the absence of a value - essentially, that the variable exists in
the namespace of the function (the directory of variable names) but that it
doesn't correspond to any existing object.

### Challenge:

1. What type of object corresponds to a variable declared as `None`? (Hint:
create a variable set to `None` and use the function `type()`)

2. Compare the behavior of the function `yearly_data_arg_test` when the
arguments have `None` as a default and when they do not have default values.

3. What happens if you only include a value for `start_year` in the function
call? Can you write the function call with only a value for `end_year`? (Hint:
think about how the function must be assigning values to each of the arguments -
this is related to the need to put the arguments without default values before
those with default values in the function definition!)

The body of the test function now has two conditional loops (if loops) that
check the values of `start_year` and `end_year`. If loops execute the body of
the loop when some condition is met. They commonly look something like this:

```python
    a = 5
    
    if a<0: # meets first condition?
        
        # if a IS less than zero
        print 'a is a negative number'
        
    elif a>0: # did not meet first condition. meets second condition?
        
        # if a ISN'T less than zero and IS more than zero
        print 'a is a positive number'
        
    else: # met neither condition
        
        # if a ISN'T less than zero and ISN'T more than zero
        print 'a must be zero!'

    a is a positive number
```

Change the value of `a` to see how this function works. The statement `elif`
means "else if", and all of the conditional statements must end in a colon.

The if loops in the function `yearly_data_arg_test` check whether there is an
object associated with the variable names `start_year` and `end_year`. If those
variables are `None`, the if loops return the boolean `True` and execute whaever
is in their body. On the other hand, if the variable names are associated with
some value (they got a number in the function call), the if loops return `False`
and do not execute. The opposite conditional statements, which would return
`True` if the variables were associated with objects (if they had received value
in the function call), would be `if start_year` and `if end_year`.

As we've written it so far, the function `yearly_data_arg_test` associates
values in the function call with arguments in the function definition just based
in their order. If the function gets only two values in the function call, the
first one will be associated with `all_data` and the second with `start_year`,
regardless of what we intended them to be. We can get around this problem by
calling the function using keyword arguments, where each of the arguments in the
function definition is associated with a keyword and the function call passes
values to the function using these keywords:

```python
    def yearly_data_arg_test(all_data, start_year = None, end_year = None):
        """
        Modified from yearly_data_csv_writer to test default argument values!
    
        start_year --- the first year of data we want --- default: None - check all_data
        end_year --- the last year of data we want --- default: None - check all_data
        all_data --- DataFrame with multi-year data
        """
        
        if not start_year:
            start_year = min(all_data.year)
        if not end_year:
            end_year = max(all_data.year)
        
        return start_year, end_year
            
    
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df)
    print 'Default values:\t\t\t', start, end
        
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df, 1988, 1993)
    print 'No keywords:\t\t\t', start, end
    
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df, start_year = 1988, end_year = 1993)
    print 'Both keywords, in order:\t', start, end
    
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df, end_year = 1993, start_year = 1988)
    print 'Both keywords, flipped:\t\t', start, end
    
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df, start_year = 1988)
    print 'One keyword, default end:\t', start, end
    
    start,end = yearly_data_arg_test (surveys_df, end_year = 1993)
    print 'One keyword, default start:\t', start, end
```
```
    Default values:			1977 2002
    No keywords:			1988 1993
    Both keywords, in order:	1988 1993
    Both keywords, flipped:		1988 1993
    One keyword, default end:	1988 2002
    One keyword, default start:	1977 1993
```

### Challenge:

1. Rewrite the `one_year_csv_writer` and `yearly_data_csv_writer` functions to
have keyword arguments with default values

2. Modify the functions so that they don't create yearly files if there is no
data for a given year and display an alert to the user (Hint: use conditional
statements and if loops to do this. For an extra challenge, use `try`
statements!)

3. The code below checks to see whether a directory exists and creates one if it doesn't. Add some code to your function that writes out the CSV files, to check for a directory to write to.

```Python 
	if 'dirNameHere' in os.listdir('.'):
	    print 'Processed directory exists'
	else:
	    os.mkdir('dirNameHere')
	    print 'Processed directory created' 
```

4. The code that you have written so far to loop through the years is good, however it is not necessarily reproducible with different datasets. For instance, what happens to the code if we have additional years of data in our CSV files? Using the tools that you learned in the previous activities, make a list of all years represented in the data. Then create a loop to process your data, that begins at the earliest year and ends at the latest year using that list.

HINT: you can create a loop with a list as follows: `for years in yearList:`
