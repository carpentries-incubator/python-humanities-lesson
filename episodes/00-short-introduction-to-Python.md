# The Basics of Python

Python is a general purpose programming language that supports rapid development
of scripts and applications.

Python's main advantages:

* Open Source software, supported by Python Software Foundation
* Available on all platforms
* It is a general-purpose programming language
* Supports multiple programming paradigms
* Very large community with a rich ecosystem of third-party packages

## Interpreter

Python is an interpreted language which can be used in two ways:

* "Interactive" Mode: It functions like an "advanced calculator" Executing
  one command at a time:

```python
user:host:~$ python
Python 3.5.1 (default, Oct 23 2015, 18:05:06)
[GCC 4.8.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World
```

* "Scripting" Mode: Executing a series of "commands" saved in text file,
  usually with a `.py` extension after the name of your file:

```bash
user:host:~$ python my_script.py
Hello World
```


## Introduction to Python built-in data types

### Strings, integers and floats

Python has built-in numeric types for integers, floats, and complex numbers.
Strings are a built-in textual type.:

```python
text = "Data Carpentry"
number = 42
pi_value = 3.1415
```

Here we've assigned data to variables, namely `text`, `number` and `pi_value`,
using the assignment operator `=`. The variable called `text` is a string which
means it can contain letters and numbers. Notice that in order to define a
string you need to have quotes around your text. To print out the value
stored in a variable we can simply type the name of the variable into the
interpreter:

```python
>>> text
"Data Carpentry"
```

However, in a script, a `print` function is needed to output the `text`:

*example.py*
```python
# A Python script file
# Comments in Python start with #
# The next line uses the print function to print out the text string
print(text)
```
*Running the script*
```bash
$ python example.py
Data Carpentry
```

**Tip**: The `print` function is a built-in function in Python. Later in this
lesson, we will introduce methods and user-defined functions. The Python
documentation is excellent for reference on the differences between them.

### Operators

We can perform mathematical calculations in Python using the basic operators
 `+, -, /, *, %`:

```python
>>> 2 + 2   #  addition
4
>>> 6 * 7   #  multiplication
42
>>> 2 ** 16  # power
65536
>>> 13 % 5  # modulo
3
```

We can also use comparison and logic operators:
`<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=` and statements of identity such as
`and, or, not`. The data type returned by this is
called a _boolean_.


```python
>>> 3 > 4
False
>>> True and True
True
>>> True or False
True
```

## Sequential types: Lists and Tuples

### Lists

**Lists** are a common data structure to hold an ordered sequence of
elements. Each element can be accessed by an index.  Note that Python
indexes start with 0 instead of 1:

```python
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3]
>>> numbers[0]
1
```

A `for` loop can be used to access the elements in a list or other Python data
structure one at a time:

```python
>>> for num in numbers:
...     print(num)
...
1
2
3
>>>
```

**Indentation** is very important in Python. Note that the second line in the
example above is indented. Just like three chevrons `>>>` indicate an
interactive prompt in Python, the three dots `...` are Python's prompt for
multiple lines. This is Python's way of marking a block of code. [Note: you
do not type `>>>` or `...`.]

To add elements to the end of a list, we can use the `append` method. Methods
are a way to interact with an object (a list, for example). We can invoke a
method using the dot `.` followed by the method name and a list of arguments
in parentheses. Let's look at an example using `append`:

```python
>>> numbers.append(4)
>>> print(numbers)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>>
```

To find out what methods are available for an
object, we can use the built-in `help` command:

```python
help(numbers)

Help on list object:

class list(object)
 |  list() -> new empty list
 |  list(iterable) -> new list initialized from iterable's items
 ...
```

### Tuples

A tuple is similar to a list in that it's an ordered sequence of elements.
However, tuples can not be changed once created (they are "immutable"). Tuples
are created by placing comma-separated values inside parentheses `()`.

```python
# tuples use parentheses
a_tuple= (1, 2, 3)
another_tuple = ('blue', 'green', 'red')
# Note: lists use square brackets
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

> 1. What happens when you type `a_tuple[2]=5` vs `a_list[1]=5` ?
> 2. Type `type(a_tuple)` into python - what is the object type?

## Dictionaries

A **dictionary** is a container that holds pairs of objects - keys and values.

```python
>>> translation = {'one': 1, 'two': 2}
>>> translation['one']
1
```
Dictionaries work a lot like lists - except that you index them with *keys*.
You can think about a key as a name for or a unique identifier for a set of values
in the dictionary. Keys can only have particular types - they have to be
"hashable". Strings and numeric types are acceptable, but lists aren't.

```python
>>> rev = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}
>>> rev[1]
'one'
>>> bad = {[1, 2, 3]: 3}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

In Python, a "Traceback" is an multi-line error block printed out for the
user.

To add an item to the dictionary we assign a value to a new key:

```python
>>> rev = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}
>>> rev[3] = 'three'
>>> rev
{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
```

Using `for` loops with dictionaries is a little more complicated. We can do
this in two ways:

```python
>>> for key, value in rev.items():
...     print(key, '->', value)
...
1 -> one
2 -> two
3 -> three
```

or

```python
>>> for key in rev.keys():
...     print(key, '->', rev[key])
...
1 -> one
2 -> two
3 -> three
>>>
```

> ## Challenge - Can you do reassignment in a dictionary?
> 
> 1. First check what `rev` is right now (remember `rev` is the name of our dictionary). 
>     
>    Type:
> ```python
> >>> rev
> ```
>
> 2. Try to reassign the second value (in the *key value pair*) so that it no longer reads "two" but instead reads "apple-sauce". 
>
> 3. Now display `rev` again to see if it has changed. 
>

It is important to note that dictionaries are "unordered" and do not remember
the sequence of their items (i.e. the order in which key:value pairs were
added to the dictionary). Because of this, the order in which items are
returned from loops over dictionaries might appear random and can even change
with time.



## Functions

Defining a section of code as a function in Python is done using the `def`
keyword. For example a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum
can be defined as:

```python
def add_function(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

z = add_function(20, 22)
print(z)
42
```

Key points about functions are:

* definition starts with `def`
* function body is indented
* `return` keyword precedes returned value
