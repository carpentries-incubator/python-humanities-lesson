The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **file system**.
It is composed of files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called "folders"),
which hold files or other directories. Several shell commands can be used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. While you can do many of these things in the desktop environment of your own computer, these commands are fundamental for navigating the file system of  remote machines and supercomputers.

Start by opening a shell window. You can do this by opening the Terminal in MacOS or Linux, or using an application such as Git Bash or Cygwin in Windows.

~~~ {.input}
$
~~~

The dollar sign is a **prompt** that shows us that the shell is waiting for input. Your shell might show something more elaborate, like the name of your computer and your current directory followed by the prompt.

Type the command `whoami` and press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.

In response, the shell will print the command’s output. The command `whoami` prints the ID of the current user,
i.e.,
it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

~~~ {.input}
$ whoami
~~~
~~~ {.output}
nelle
~~~

More specifically, when we type `whoami` the shell:

1.  finds a program called `whoami`,
2.  runs that program,
3.  displays that program's output, then
4.  displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

We can also find out where we are in the file system by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory").
Our **current working directory** (the directory in which we are) 
is the directory where the computer assumes we want to run commands,
unless we explicitly specify something else. If you run a command that creates a new file, for example, the file will, by default, be created in the current working directory.
Here,
the computer's response is `/users/nelle`,
which is Nelle's **home directory**. The output to the `pwd` command in your computer will almost surely be different (since your name is probably not Nelle!), and it might not even be your home directory:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/users/nelle
~~~

To understand what a "home directory" is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.
At the top is the **root directory**,
which holds everything that is inside the file system.
We point to the root directory using a slash character `/`;
this is the leading slash in `/users/nelle`.

The root directory contains multiple other directories, depending on your operating system and the particular configuration of your computer. From the output to the command `pwd`, we know that Nelle’s root directory (indicated by the first `/`) contains at least one directory, the folder "users" (`/users`). The directory `users` in turn contains at least one directory, a folder named "nelle” (`/users/nelle`).

> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a name,
> it just serves as a separator.

We can see what’s inside the current working directory (in Nelle’s case, her home directory) using the command `ls`, which stands for "listing":

~~~ {.input}
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
creatures  molecules           pizza.cfg
data       north-pacific-gyre  solar.pdf
Desktop    notes.txt           writing
~~~

The command `ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order,
arranged neatly into columns.
We can make its output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`,
which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F
~~~
~~~ {.output}
creatures/  molecules/           pizza.cfg
data/       north-pacific-gyre/  solar.pdf
Desktop/    notes.txt            writing/
~~~

This is a case where the slash is serving as a separator - a name with a trailing `/` indicates that it is not a file but a directory, which could have more files and directories inside.

Here,
we can see that `/users/nelle` contains seven **sub-directories**.
The names that don't have trailing slashes,
like `notes.txt`, `pizza.cfg`, and `solar.pdf`,
are plain old files.
And note that there is a space between `ls` and `-F`:
without it,
the shell thinks we're trying to run a command called `ls-F`,
which doesn't exist.

Now let's take a look at what's in Nelle's `data` directory by running `ls -F data`,
i.e.,
the command `ls` with the **arguments** `-F` and `data`.
The second argument --- the one *without* a leading dash --- tells `ls` that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F data
~~~
~~~ {.output}
amino-acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt
~~~

The output shows us that there are four text files and two sub-sub-directories.
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Notice, by the way that we spelled the directory name `data`.
It doesn't have a trailing slash:
that's added to directory names by `ls` when we use the `-F` flag to help us tell things apart.
And it doesn't begin with a slash because it's a **relative path**,
i.e., it tells `ls` how to find something from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.

If we run `ls -F /data` (*with* a leading slash) we get a different answer,
because `/data` is an **absolute path**:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F /data
~~~
~~~ {.output}
access.log    backup/    hardware.cfg
network.cfg
~~~

The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the filesystem,
so it always refers to exactly one directory,
no matter where we are when we run the command.

What if we want to change our current working directory?
Before we do this,
`pwd` shows us that we're in `/users/nelle`,
and `ls` without any arguments shows us that directory's contents:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/users/nelle
~~~
~~~ {.input}
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
creatures  molecules           pizza.cfg
data       north-pacific-gyre  solar.pdf
Desktop    notes.txt           writing
~~~

We can use `cd` followed by a directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for "change directory",
which is a bit misleading:
the command doesn't change the directory,
it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.

~~~ {.input}
$ cd data
~~~

`cd` doesn't print anything,
but if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now in `/users/nelle/data`.
If we run `ls` without arguments now,
it lists the contents of `/users/nelle/data`,
because that's where we now are:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/users/nelle/data
~~~
~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F
~~~
~~~ {.output}
amino-acids.txt   elements/     morse.txt
pdb/              planets.txt   sunspot.txt
~~~

We now know how to go down the directory tree:
how do we go up?
We could use an absolute path:

~~~ {.input}
$ cd /users/nelle
~~~

but it's almost always simpler to use `cd ..` to go up one level:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/users/nelle/data
~~~
~~~ {.input}
$ cd ..
~~~

`..` is a special directory name meaning
"the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly,
the **parent** of the current directory.
Sure enough,
if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/users/nelle`:

~~~ {.input}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/users/nelle
~~~

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`.
If we want to display it, we can give `ls` the `-a` flag:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls -F -a
~~~
~~~ {.output}
./                  creatures/          notes.txt
../                 data/               pizza.cfg
.bash_profile       molecules/          solar.pdf
Desktop/            north-pacific-gyre/ writing/
~~~

`-a` stands for "show all";
it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`,
such as `..` (which, if we're in `/users/nelle`, refers to the `/users` directory).
As you can see,
it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`,
which means "the current working directory".
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.  
Finally, we also see a file called `.bash_profile`. This file usually contains settings to customize the shell (terminal). There may also be similar files called `.bashrc` or `.bash_login`. For this lesson material it does not contain any settings.

### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing just this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

> Nelle names her directories "year-month-day",
> with leading zeroes for months and days,
> because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
> If she used month names,
> December would come before July;
> if she didn't use leading zeroes,
> November ('11') would come before July ('7').

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as "NENE01729A".
This is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

If she is in her home directory,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
~~~

This is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work.
If she types:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls nor
~~~

and then presses tab,
the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

~~~ {.input}
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
~~~

If she presses tab again,
Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command,
since it's the only possible completion.
Pressing tab again does nothing,
since there are 1520 possibilities;
pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,
and so on.
This is called **tab completion**,
and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.
