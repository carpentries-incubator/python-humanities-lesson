# Data Types and Formats

The format of individual columns and rows will impact analysis performed on a dataset read into python. For example, you can't perform mathematical calculations on a string (character formatted data). This might seem obvious, however sometimes numeric values  import into python in a string format. In turn, when you try to perform calculations on the numeric data, you get an error.

In this lesson we will review ways to explore and better understand the structure and format of our data.

##Learning Objectives

* Learn about character and numeric data types
* Learn how to explore the structure of your data 
* Understand NaN values and different ways to deal with them.

#Types of Data

Let's begin by talking about data types. How information is stored in a DataFrame or a python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of calculations as well. 

#Numeric Data Types
Numeric data types include integers or floats. A **floating point** (known as a float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For example: 1.13, 2.0 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data type so the decimal points are not lost.

An **integer** will never have a decimal point. Thus 1.13 would be stored as 1. 1234.345 is stored as 1234. You will often see the data type Int64 in python which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64 simply refers to the memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits in can store in each "cell". Allocating space ahead of time allows computers to optimize storage and processing efficiency.

## Character Data Types 
Objects, known as strings in Pandas, are values that contain numbers and / or characters. For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences. A string (or Pandas object) might also be a plot name like 'plot1'. A string can also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, '1234' could be stored as a string. As could '10.23'. However **strings that contain numbers can not be used for mathematical operations**!  


Pandas and base Python use slightly different names for data types. More on this is in the table below:

|Name of Pandas type | Function | Base Python Equivalent |
|------------|---------|-------------------------|
|Object | The most general dtype. Will be assigned to your column if column has mixed types (numbers and strings). | String | 
|int64 | Numerical characters. 64 refers to the memory allocated to hold this character. | Int. |
| float64 | Numerical characters with decimals. If a column contains numbers and NaNs(see below), pandas will default to float64, in case your missing value has a decimal. | float |
|datetime64, timedelta[ns] | Values meant to hold time data. Look into these for time series experiments. | -- |


##Checking the format of our data
Now that we're armed with a basic understanding of numeric and character data types, let's explore our data. We'll be working with the same `surveys.csv` dataset that we've used in previous lessons.

```python
#note the pd.read_csv is used because we imported pandas as pd
surveys_df=pd.read_csv("data/biology/surveys.csv")
``` 

Remember that we can check the type of an object like this:

```Python
type(surveys_df)
```

**OUTPUT:**

	pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
	

Next, let's look at the structure of our surveys data. In pandas, we can check the type of one column in a DataFrame using the syntax `dataFrameName[column_name].dtype`:

```Python
surveys_df['sex'].dtype

```
**OUTPUT:** 

dtype('O')

A type 'O' just stands for "object" which in Pandas world is a string (characters). 


```Python

surveys_df['record_id'].dtype

```

**OUTPUT:** 

dtype('int64')

The type `Int 64` tells us that python is storing each value within this column as a 64 bit integer. We can use the `dat.dtypes` command to view the data type for each column in a DataFrame (all at once). 

	surveys_df.dtypes

which **returns**: 

```
record_id      int64
month          int64
day            int64
year           int64
plot           int64
species       object
sex           object
wgt          float64
dtype: object
```
Note that most of the columns in our Survey data are of type `int64`. This means that they are 64 bit integers. But the wgt column is a floating point value which means it contains decimals. The species and sex columns are objects which means they contains strings.


## Working With Integers and floats 

So we've learned that computers store numbers in one of two ways: as integers or as floating-point numbers (or floats). Integers are the numbers we usually count with. Floats have fractional parts (decimal places).  Let's next consider how the data type can impact mathematical operations on our data. Addition, subtraction and multiplication work on floats and integers as we'd expect. However,  division works differently. 

	print 5+5
	10

	print 24-4
	20

If we divide one integer by another, we get the quotient without the remainder. In the example below, 9 goes into 5 as an integer 0 times.

	print 5/9
	0
	#3 goes into 10, 3 times
	print 10/3
	3


If either part of the division is a float, on the other hand, the computer creates a floating-point answer:

	print '10.0/3 is:', 10.0/3
	10.0/3 is: 3.33333333333

The computer does this for historical reasons: integer operations were much faster on early machines, and this behavior is actually useful in a lot of situations. It's still confusing, though, so Python 3 produces a floating-point answer when dividing integers if it needs to. We're still using Python 2.7 in this class though, so if we want 5/9 to give us the right answer, we have to write it as 5.0/9, 5/9.0, or some other variation.

Another way to create a floating-point answer is to explicitly tell the computer that you desire one. This is achieved by casting one of the numbers as a float:

	print 'float(10)/3 is:', float(10)/3

We can also convert a floating point number to an integer. Notice that Python by default rounds down when it converts from floating point to integer.

	a=7.33
	#convert a to integer
	int(a)
	7

	b=7.89
	int(b)
	7

# Working With Our Survey Data

Getting back to our data, we can modify the format of values within our data, if we want. For instance, we could convert the `record_id` field to floating point values. 

```python
	#convert the record_id field from an integer to a float
	surveys_df['record_id'] = surveys_df['record_id'].astype('float64')
	surveys_df['record_id'].dtype
```

**OUTPUT:**

dtype('float64')


What happens if we try to convert weight values to integers? 

	surveys_df['wgt'].astype('int')

Notice that this throws a value error `ValueError: Cannot convert NA to integer`.  If we look at the `wgt` column in the surveys data we notice that there are NaN (**N**ot **a** **N**umber) values. *NaN* values are undefined values that cannot be represented mathematically. Pandas, for example, will read an empty cell in a CSV or Excel sheet as a NaN. NaNs have some desirable properties: if we were to average the 'wgt' column without replacing our NaNs, Python would know to skip over those cells.

```python
surveys_df['wgt'].mean()
42.672428212991356
```

## Missing Data Values - NaN 
Dealing with missing data values is always a challenge. It's sometimes hard to know why values are missing - was it because of a data entry error? Or data that someone was unable to collect? Should the value be 0? We need to know how missing values are represented in the dataset in order to make good decisions. If we're lucky, we have some metadata that will tell us more about how null values were handled.

For instance, in some disciplines, like Remote Sensing, missing data values are often defined as -9999. Having a bunch of -9999 values in your data could really alter numeric calculations. Often in spreadsheets, cells are left empty where no data are available. Python will, by default replace those missing values with NaN. However it is good practice to get in the habit of intentionally marking cells that have no data, with a no data value! That way there are no questions in the future when you (or someone else) explores your data.

###Where Are the NaN's?
Let's explore the NaN values in our data a bit further. Using the tools we learned in lesson 02, we can figure out how many rows contain NaN values for weight. We can also create a new subset from our data that only contains rows with weight values > 0 (ie select meaningful weight values). 

	len(surveys_df[pd.isnull(surveys_df.wgt)])
	#how many rows have wgt values?
	len(surveys_df[surveys_df.wgt> 0])


We can replace all NaN values with zeroes using the `.fillna()' method (after making a copy of the data so we don't lose our work. 

	df1 = surveys_df
	#fill all NaN values with 0
	df1['wgt'] = df1['wgt'].fillna(0)

However NaN and 0 yield different analysis results. The mean value when NaN values are replaced with 0 is different from when NaN values are simply thrown out or ignored. 

```python

df1['wgt'].mean()
38.751976145601844
```

We can fill NaN values with any value that we chose. The code below fills all NaN values with a mean for all wgt values.

```python
 df1['wgt'] = df['wgt'].fillna(df['wgt'].mean())
```

We could also chose to create a subset of our data, only keeping rows that do not contains NaN values. 

The point of this is we need to make conscious decisions about how to manage missing data. This is where we think about how our data will be used and how these values will impact the scientific conclusions made from the data.

Python gives us all of the tools that we need to account for these issues. We just need to be cautious, about how the decisions that we make, impact scientific results.
