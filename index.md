Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools
for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less
pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested in working with
ecological data in Python.


## Lessons

- [Short Introduction to Python](00-short-introduction-to-Python)
- [Starting With Data](01-starting-with-data)
- [Index Slice Subset](02-index-slice-subset)
- [Data Types and Format](03-data-types-and-format)
- [Merging Data](04-merging-data)
- [Data Analysis Automation: Loops and Functions](05-loops-and-functions)
- [Plotting with Matplotlib](06-plotting-with-matplotlib)
- [Putting It All Together](07-putting-it-all-together)
- [Accessing SQL using Python](08-working-with-sql)


## Data

Data for this lesson is from the Portal Project Teaching Database -
[available on FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459).

Specifically, the data files we use in these lessons are:

- [surveys.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172)
- [species.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483)


## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to bring
in and use their own laptops to ensure the proper setup of tools for an
efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.  (We will provide instructions
on setting up the required software several days in advance).  _There are no
pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools._
Participants are required to abide by Software Carpentry's
[Code of Conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/).
